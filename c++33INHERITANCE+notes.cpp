// ~~NOTES~~
// 1. RESUABILITY IS VERY IMPORTANT FEATURE OF OOPS
// 2. THE CONCEPT OF REUSBILITY IN C++ IS SUPPORTED USING INHERITANCE
// 3. EXISTING CLASS IS CALLED BASE CLASS
// /*
// base class is main class jisse data liya jayega and derived class is which jisko data chaiye 
// jisme data import hoga
// */
// 4. THERE CAN BE MULTIPLE BASE AND DERIVED CLASS 

// /* TYPES OF INHRITANCE 
// 1. MULTIPLE INHERITANCE  --> a derived class with more than one base class
// 2. HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE  --> several derived class from a single base class
// 3. MULTILEVEL INHRITANCE  --> deriving a class from already existing derived class 
// 4. HYBRID INHERITANCE  --> is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance 
// 5. SINGLE INHERITANCE  --> a derived class with only one base
